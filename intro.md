# Introduction / Business Problem
The problem that this data science project is aimed on is to use several conditions about a car accident that can be observed, such as 
weather condition, car type and road traffic load. The severity data can then be used to determine the priority to the accidents around the world, 
or to determine if helicopters/how many people should be used to rescure survivors. The severity can also gives an overall classifying of the magnitude 
of the accident, thus giving emergency rescurers a priority sequence thtat they should go to.

The city government and transportation departments are the main target audience of the data. They can use this data to 
generate annual reports to summarize the overall accident status and make suggestions to improve the overall safety. Researchers 
in the government can also use the data to determine places where most accident tend to happen, and thus place warning signs to prevent accidents.
