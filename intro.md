# Introduction / Business Problem
The problem that this data science project is aimed on is to use several conditions about a car accident that can be observed, such as 
weather condition, car type and road traffic load. The severity data can then be used to determine the priority to the accidents around the world, 
or to determine if helicopters should be used to rescure survivors. The data is particularly useful to city government and transportation departments, 
so that they can generate annual reports to summarize the overall accident status and make suggestions to improve the overall safety.
